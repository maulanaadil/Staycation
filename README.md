# Staycation

This project base an a course Full-Stack Javascript Developer from [Buildwith Angga](https://buildwithangga.com/) 
In this project there are several components that were changed according to the figma prototype that I designed

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
